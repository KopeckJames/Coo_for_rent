## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Consistency is key** - Better to publish 2 quality posts per month consistently than 10 posts one month and nothing the next

2. **Quality over quantity** - One great 2000-word article beats five 400-word fluff pieces

4. **Reviews matter** - Google reviews are one of the top 3 ranking factors for local search

5. **Be patient** - SEO takes 3-6 months to show results. Stay consistent and trust the process

6. **Track everything** - You can't improve what you don't measure

7. **Answer questions** - Create content that answers your prospects' questions

8. **Build relationships** - SEO is about building authority and trust, not gaming the system
